Recently, Github has been : 
- Blocking developer accounts from some countries : https://github.com/tkashkin/GameHub/issues/289
- Blocking a software that helped organize opposition following a government's request : https://www.vice.com/en/article/9kevn7/spain-and-github-are-blocking-an-app-that-helped-protesters-organize
- Blocking software, following american laws, to protect private interests : https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/software/youtube-dl-removed-from-github-after-riaa-dmca-notice/

Github is not politicaly neutral. Github serves (american) power.

Today, I removed all my projects from Github.
